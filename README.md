**Constellation** is an open source platform for building easy to use and update scheduling systems for schools.  

This project is built on top of node js, electron, jade, and postgreSQL to make editing and tailoring easy for programmers both experienced and new. We also strive to keep the user interface as simple as possible, therefore little to no base CSS is provided to allow customization without worry of overrides. (This may change as I get tired of how base html input boxes look)

# Installation

To install and get running simply clone the repo and make sure that you have node js installed and up to date, run:

> **npm install**

Then after all dependencies are installed, run:

> **npm start**

To start the app server on localhost:3000 (default but can be changed)

> Note that the html2jade.zip file will need to be unziped and installed/run in the same way but inside its own directory. It was origianlly a seperate project that I added to make contribution easier for non-jade programmers.
